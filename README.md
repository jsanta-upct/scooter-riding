**Dataset Description: On-Board Unit Data from an Electric Scooter**

The dataset includes extensive information gathered from an on-board unit (OBU) installed on an electric scooter. The data covers a range of scenarios, such as static conditions, conventional driving, lateral rollovers, and frontal collisions.

The dataset includes parameters such as acceleration measurements, orientation, GPS position, gravity, gyroscopic orientation, illumination, and atmospheric pressure, providing valuable insights into the scooter's performance and safety under different conditions.

**Data Organization**:
- Each folder holds data from a particular test scenario, clearly labeled to reflect the nature of the test.
- Within each folder, a README file provides pertinent details about the test conducted.
- Each folder contains a collection of files, one for each parameter collected, all in CSV format.
Additional multimedia files, such as photos or videos, may be included to help understand specific test scenarios.
